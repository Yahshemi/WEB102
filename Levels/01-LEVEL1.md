# LEVEL 1: Clear Your Taskbar


*You are no longer a typical computer user. As the first step in setting up your workstation, we recommend clearing your taskbar of apps that are not helpful in your day to day activity as a software engineer and adding only those that are helpful.*

Objectives

#### These are the apps we recommend you keep:


---

> Finder
> System Preferences
> Launch Pad
> Downloads
> Trash

---

*TIP: As you install additional apps, add them to your taskbar too.*
